This assumes you [have Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and you've already checked out the Git repository using `git clone https://github.com/cjcurrie/aso-app.git`.

Install npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

In an [admin-elevated shell](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/open-elevated-command-prompt-windows/), [navigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) to the project directory you cloned and run `npm install`. This will create a node_modules folder and install the necessary dependencies, such as Firebase and React.

To begin hosting a local developer instance, run `npm run dev`.

In a browser navigate to [localhost:1234](localhost:1234).

Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12 key) and check the Console to debug the project.
